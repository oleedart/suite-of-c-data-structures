### Testing 'bag'

To test my *bag* module I wrote a test program, [bagtest](bagtest.c), to explore the capabilities of the *bag* data structure and to demonstrate the use of a non-trivial `item` type.

Add more description here about your test program bagtest.c.

### Test run

An example test run is in `bagtest.out`, built with

	make test &> bagtest.out

In that file one can see the progress of building a bag, the results of `bag_print`, and add more there.

### Limitations

I never tested `bag_extract`!
I really should write another loop, or another test program, to test the extraction of some items from the bag.
